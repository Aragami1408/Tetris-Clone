    MAKEFILE PROJECT : 3ds Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this 3ds project for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your 3ds project.


3ds.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

3ds.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

This project allows you to build/clean/rebuild from within Visual Studio by calling the commands you have input 
in the wizard. The build command can be nmake or any other tool you use.

This project does not contain any files, so there are none displayed in Solution Explorer.

the text above was made by a bot

the port is not using sdl however I had to make my own version.
The reason was that it would be too much work removing all the SDL_, which there are alot of by the way.
plus it would let me use alot more of sdl on windows.

yes, I know I used alot of copy and paste from the sdl source code
alot of the code was copyed from sdl, and not made by me!!
but alot of it was made by me
any code from sdl I will not claim to be mine
